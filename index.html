            “Many years ago, I went to a witch who guided me through a shamanic trance to find my
            inner temple and sacred weapons. When I got there it was a cave of black water on a
            distant moon and my ‘weapons’ were a strand of bowel, a tumor with hair, blood clots,
            and bits of brain. It’s always made me laugh. Years later⁣ Amazon recommended my own
            book to me. These two events are of the most mystically uncanny of my life. I don’t
            think we can talk about the mystical only in terms of transcendence. More often it’s a
            state of anti-climax, body horror, confusion, doom, and dread, and it is precisely this
            paradox that makes it mystical.” —Johanna Hedva

          GLUT (a superabundance of nothing), by Johanna Hedva, is an inquiry into the knowings and
          unknowings of embodiment. It is a sound work composed with divination and AI, which
          manifests as both an immersive physical installation and videogame. The core of GLUT is a
          sound composition made entirely of Hedva’s voice, ranging from its rawest expression of
          screams, to two AI vocal clones that have been manipulated to sound ever more de-human.
          Disturbed that vocal-clone software services reserve the right to sell client voice data
          to government and corporate regimes, Hedva worked with Jessika Khazrik to trick the
          software, training it with Hedva’s voice already disguised through machinic vocoding
          processes. The AI voices speak a text corpus built by Hedva and synthesized through
          divination. The corpus is composed of the writings of medieval mystics (mostly of the
          apophatic tradition); theoretical physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers writing
          about black holes, dark matter, night, and nothingness; poets and novelists on sleep,
          music, and the voice; and the algorithm of amazon.com.

          In the videogame, users are a teratoma avatar that drags itself through an environment
          cheating at non-Euclidean geometry through a series of nesting black holes, intestinal
          tunnels, glittering caves, and oceans of black water. The physical installation
          spatializes the sound in a subtly eerie immersive room, large enough for one person only,
          which has been built into the existing architecture of the HKW Berlin. With a simple bed
          covered in Anti-Fatigue Foam (a material made specifically to trick workers into not
          noticing the exhaustion of their bodies), the installation draws on the “void room”
          settings in films like Get Out and Under the Skin, a little pocket of a universe that
          amplifies the limits of the body by simultaneously erasing them. The videogame is a
          digital experience that mirrors this while producing a world that disorients as much as it
          confirms what knowledges are available to the body. Because the physical installation is
          not permanent nor wheelchair accessible, nor comfortable for some in light of COVID, Hedva
          developed the video game, with ASL and BSL commentary, as well as audio description, which
          will be available indefinitely. All aspects of accessibility were produced by Shape Arts
          as part of the Adam Reynolds Award 2021.

          In all of its iterations, GLUT is rooted in the premise that AI has existed long before
          computers in the forms of divination and mysticism, and following this premise, GLUT asks
          what, how, and where we can know and un-know what we think we do.
