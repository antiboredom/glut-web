        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          GLUT: (a superabundance of nothing), by Johanna Hedva, is an inquiry into the knowings and
          unknowings of embodiment. It is a sound work composed with divination and AI, which
          manifests as both an immersive physical installation and online videogame. The core of
          GLUT is a sound composition made entirely of Hedva’s voice, ranging from its purest, most
          raw expression, to multiple AI vocal clones that have been manipulated through vocoding
          processes to sound ever more de-human. The voices speak and scream a text corpus
          synthesized from the writings of mystics, theoretical physicists, mathematicians, and
          philosophers, and the algorithm of amazon.com. In the online videogame, users follow a
          teratoma-like avatar through a non-Euclidean environment of nesting black holes. The
          physical installation mirrors this in a subtly eerie immersive room that draws on the
          hauntingly uncanny settings of films like Get Out and Under the Skin. In all of its
          iterations, GLUT is rooted in the premise that AI has existed long before computers in the
          forms of divination and mysticism, and following this premise, GLUT asks what, how, and
          where we can know and un-know what we think we do.
