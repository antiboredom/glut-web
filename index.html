          <em>
            “Many years ago, I went to a witch who guided me through a shamanic trance to find my
            inner temple and sacred weapons. When I got there it was a cave of black water on a
            distant moon and my ‘weapons’ were a strand of bowel, a tumor with hair, blood clots,
            and bits of brain. It’s always made me laugh. Years later⁣ Amazon recommended my own
            book to me. These two events are of the most mystically uncanny of my life. I don’t
            think we can talk about the mystical only in terms of transcendence. More often it’s a
            state of anti-climax, body horror, confusion, doom, and dread, and it is precisely this
            paradox that makes it mystical.” <br>—Johanna Hedva
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>GLUT (a superabundance of nothing)</i>, by Johanna Hedva, is an inquiry into the knowings and unknowings of embodiment. 
          It is a sound work composed with divination and AI, which manifests as both an immersive physical installation and videogame. 
          The core of <i>GLUT</i> is a sound composition made entirely of Hedva’s voice, ranging from its rawest expression of screams, 
          to two AI vocal clones that, in order  to trick the surveillance tactics embedded in AI, have been manipulated to sound ever more de-human. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Disturbed that proprietary vocal-clone software services reserve the right to sell client voice data to governments and corporations, 
          Hedva worked with artist, musician, technologist, and writer Jessika Khazrik to deceive the software, training it with Hedva’s voice disguised through multiple vocoding processes. 
          Hedva and Khazrik created two vocal clones: Arid and Mud, neither of which are made from an actual human voice and therefore not actual 
          vocal clones. In <i>GLUT</i>, these two AI voices speak a text corpus that Hedva built over four lunar cycles, and synthesized through various 
          divination techniques. The corpus is composed of the writings of medieval mystics (mostly of the apophatic tradition); theoretical physicists, 
          mathematicians, and philosophers writing about black holes, dark matter, night, and nothingness; poets and novelists on sleep, music, and the voice; 
          and the algorithm of amazon.com.</p> 
        
        <p>One of the provocations of <i>GLUT</i> is the question of whether Amazon, in predicting our desires and shaping our 
          future, is our latest divining tool, a kind of contemporary mysticism. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The physical installation of <i>Glut</i> spatializes the sound in a subtly eerie, immersive room, large enough for one person only, which has been built 
          into the existing architecture of the HKW Berlin. With a simple bed covered in Anti-Fatigue Foam (a material made specifically to trick workers into <i>not</i> 
          noticing the exhaustion of their bodies), the installation draws on the dissociated “void room” settings in films like <i>Get Out</i> and <i>Under the Skin</i>,
          a little pocket of a universe that amplifies the limits of the body by simultaneously erasing them. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In the <i>Glut</i> videogame, users are a teratoma avatar that drags itself through an environment cheating at non-Euclidean geometry through a series 
          of nesting black holes, intestinal tunnels, glittering caves, and oceans of black water. The videogame is a digital experience that mirrors the physical 
          installation while producing a world that disorients as much as it confirms what knowledges are available to the body. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The physical installation is not permanent nor wheelchair accessible, nor comfortable for some in light of COVID, nor for those with claustrophobia. Because of this 
          Hedva developed the video game, with sign language versions in both ASL and BSL, as well as audio description, which will be available indefinitely. 
          All aspects of the digital version, including accessibility features and this website, were produced by Shape Arts as part of the 
          <a href="https://www.shapearts.org.uk/Blog/2021-adam-reynolds-award-johanna-hedva">Adam Reynolds Award Programme</a>, supported by Arts Council England 
          and Garfield Weston Foundation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In all of its iterations, <i>GLUT</i> is rooted in the premise that AI has existed long before
          computers in the forms of divination and mysticism, and following this premise, <i>GLUT</i> asks
          what, how, and where we can know and un-know what we think we do.

        <h2>Text</h2>

        <h3>World 1 (white world, long kafka-esque hallway)</h3>

        <p class="emph">
          (score description—mournful, eerie voices; a gritty tortured growl shoots back and forth,
          up and down; very high operatic voice drops, then fades)
        </p>

        <p>1. A voice is all you need</p>

        <p>2. The universe doesn’t care about our feelings.</p>

        <p>3. What other customers bought</p>

        <h3>World 2 (smooth black tunnel)</h3>

        <p class="emph">
          (score description—cosmic choir noise; a single voice in shepherd tone; mournful operatic
          voices shooting up like stars then crashing in with heavy noise)
        </p>

        <p>4. What draws an apple to the ground also keeps the Moon in orbit about the earth.</p>

        <p>
          5. I enter into a dead end. There, all possibilities are exhausted; the possible slips
          away and the impossible prevails.
        </p>

        <p>6. With absolute time destroyed, there was also no need for absolute space.</p>

        <h3>World 3 (glittering cave)</h3>

        <p class="emph">
          (score description—cosmic cathedral, open and airy, with screeches and ghosts; a growl
          falls in and drops; zaps and shepherd tone)
        </p>

        <p>
          7. The clearer and more obvious divine things are in themselves, the darker and more
          hidden they are to the soul naturally.
        </p>

        <p>8. The night is precisely where we perish interminably and yet can never die.</p>

        <p>9. The dividing line between pleasure and release from pain grows murky.</p>

        <p>10. The night offers toads and black dogs and corpses of the drowned.</p>

        <p>11. The wound and unwound springs of a clock on the other side of the earth.</p>

        <h3>World 4 (fur)</h3>

        <p class="emph">
          (score description—scary growling like being inside the belly of a beast; screams in blips
          and high-pitched wobbles; menacing wet darkness)
        </p>

        <p>12. Black holes have no hair.</p>

        <p>13. Approximate the cow as a sphere.</p>

        <p>14. If I had not been, there would have been no god.</p>

        <p>15. Who has written this book? I in my weakness have written it.</p>

        <h3>World 5 (non-euclidean spike tunnel)</h3>

        <p class="emph">
          (score description—scary breathing; haunted cave choir; banshee shrieking)
        </p>

        <p>16. Space by itself and time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows,</p>
        <p>and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.</p>

        <h3>World 6 (vast wave room)</h3>

        <p class="emph">
          (score description—ascending and descending voice in shrieking waves; falling howls)
        </p>

        <p>
          17. When she prayed<br />
          and the divine grace<br />
          of contemplation<br />
          descended upon her,<br />
          all her limbs<br />
          gathered together<br />
          into a ball<br />
          as if they were hot wax,<br />
          and all that could<br />
          be perceived of her<br />
          was a round mass.
        </p>

        <p>
          18. All while searching for my body within the shit of space.
        </p>

        <h3>World 7 (falling)</h3>

        <p class="emph">
          (score description—swells of evil voices fading in and away; ripples of machine-screams)
        </p>

        <p>
          19. But it's the voice that enters us. Even <br />
          Saying nothing. Even saying nothing <br />
          Over and over absently to itself.
        </p>

        <p>20. Perhaps that’s the way with music. What’s the point if it doesn’t hurt?</p>

        <p>21. [The soul] takes such tiny steps.</p>

        <p>22. Was this helpful?</p>
        </p>
